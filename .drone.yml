      # Not mandatory; enables pre-fetching of images in parallel with the build, so may save

      prefetch_images:
        - "redis:4.0.6"
      # Not mandatory; sets up image name 'aliases' by pulling from one registry and tagging
      #  as a different name. Intended as a simplistic mechanism for using a private registry
      #  rather than Docker Hub for a known set of images. Accepts a dictionary of
      #  private registry image name to the Docker Hub image that it is a substitute for.
      #  Note that all images are pulled synchronously before the build starts, so this is
      #  inefficient if any unnecessary images are listed.
